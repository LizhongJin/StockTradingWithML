# StockTradingWithML
This repository is trying to do Stock Trading prediction with Machine Learning Algorithm. This is different with stock closing price prediction, and I do not focus on closing price prediction because it would be impossible to predict the price because of the marketing inefficiency. And even you got not much perfect predicted closing price, there would not be much help for trading especially in a market with T+1 trading rule.
